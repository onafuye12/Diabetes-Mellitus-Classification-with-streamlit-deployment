# Diabetes Mellitus Classification with Streamlit Deployment

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that focuses on the classification of diabetes mellitus using a Streamlit web application for deployment.

## Project Overview

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. This project aims to develop an accurate classification model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on their medical features.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance
- Streamlit web application for user-friendly deployment
- Interactive visualization of results

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation
- `models/`: Saved trained models
- `app.py`: Streamlit application code for deployment
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-mellitus-classification.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`
